- Check for design documents that may provide project context
- Look for architectural diagrams or explanations in markdown
- Reference coding standards or style guides defined in project docs
- Follow specific project conventions defined in documentation
- Use information from documentation to guide implementation choices
- Respect security guidelines outlined in SECURITY.md
- Consider roadmap information from project planning documents

Application Structure:
- Organize code using blueprints for modularity
